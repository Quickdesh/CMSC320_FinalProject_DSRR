## Why did we chose these datasets ?

As avid fans of Apex Legends, we were curious to find the aspects of the updates, introduced through various seasons over time, that affected user reviews and the monthly player breakdown of the game.

We will be comparing the seasons along with the behaviour of players, as shown in the breakdown and the reviews left by the users. Additionally, we will use the reviews to gauge the impressions that each update left on the playerbase.

Our eventual goal is to find the right ingredients to craft the ideal Apex Legends Season. We also intend to determine the theoretical best time to release such an update.
